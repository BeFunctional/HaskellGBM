# HaskellGBM

A Haskell wrapper around the [Microsoft LightGBM
library](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM) for machine learning
uses.  The emphasis here is on using Haskell types to help ensure that
the hyperparameter settings chosen by the user are coherent and
in-bounds at all times.

This software is not on Hackage yet - in the meantime you can find
Haddock API documentation
[here](https://dpkatz.github.io/haddocks/HaskellGBM-0.1.0.0/index.html)
and a tutorial blog post
[here](https://dpkatz.github.io/posts/using-lightgbm-from-haskell/).

__N.B. This package is still under heavy development including API
changes.  Contributions and pu;ll requests are welcome.__
